      "I'm a Senior Software Engineer who enjoys building things that live on the web. I've been learning programming since I was 14, and after graduating from university in Waterford, Ireland in 2016, I started my career at Fenergo in Dublin as a Software Engineer in Test — which quickly evolved into full-stack development.",
      "In 2017 I moved to Gdynia, Poland to pursue more interesting projects as a software engineer. Since then, I've had the privilege of working with major organizations including Novartis, British Council, Lufthansa Systems, and clients like Boeing, Danfoss, and Signal Ocean. My focus these days is on architecting executive dashboards and data pipelines that deliver real-time insights to stakeholders.",
      "Outside of client work, I've been focused on building products that integrate generative AI and autonomous agents into developer and software team workflows. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies or contributing to open-source projects."
